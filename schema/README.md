| [AddOn](https://schema.nfh.global/AddOn/README.md) | v2.0 | Add-on to a catalog resource |
| [Address](https://schema.nfh.global/Address/README.md) | v2.0 | **Postal address** aligned with schema.org `PostalAddress`. Use for human-readable addresses. Geometry lives in `Location.geo` as GeoJSON. |

| [CallbackAction](https://schema.nfh.global/CallbackAction/README.md) | v2.0 | DEPRECATED. This schema is structurally invalid and does not validate any payloads — the oneOf keyword was incorrectly nested inside properties, which is not valid JSON Schema. The $id also lacked a version segment.
Use https://schema.nfh.global/BecknAction/v2.0 instead. BecknAction is the unified envelope for all Beckn actions (both request and callback directions).

This schema will be removed in a future major version. |

| [Contract](https://schema.nfh.global/Contract/README.md) | v2.0 | This is a JSON-LD compliant, linked-data schema that specifies a generic multi-party, digitally signed Contract between a set of participants. based on the vocabulary defined in the @context.

Alternate description A digitally agreed commitment between two or more participants governing the exchange of economic or non-economic value.  Contract is the canonical contract object in the generalized Beckn v2.1 protocol. It replaces the commerce-specific Order construct as the canonical transaction object at the API layer.  A Contract binds:  - Commitments (what is agreed)  - Consideration (value promised)  - Performance (how execution occurs)  - Settlements (how consideration is discharged)  The model is domain-neutral and supports commerce, hiring, energy markets, carbon exchanges, data access, mobility, subscriptions, and other use cases. |

| [CounterSignature](https://schema.nfh.global/CounterSignature/README.md) | v2.0 | A signed receipt transmitted in the synchronous `Ack` response body, proving that the
receiver authenticated, received, and processed the inbound request.

`CounterSignature` shares the same wire format as `Signature` but differs:

- **`digest`**: covers the Ack response body (not the inbound request body)
- **`(request-digest)`** and **`(message-id)`** MUST be included in the signing string

Domain specification authors can attach rich context and types via `performanceAttributes`.

For example, Hyperlocal delivery details (pickup/delivery locations, items shipped, agent, etc.)
are placed inside performanceAttributes using a well-known domain schema such as
HyperlocalDelivery. Use the generic Attributes schema when no well-known
domain schema exists. |

This schema is part of the Long Term Support of Beckn Protocol V2.0 API specification and MUST NOT be extended. Any domain-specific extension must use the property of this schema which is of type Attribute. |
| [Quantity](https://schema.nfh.global/Quantity/README.md) | v2.0 | Schema definition for Quantity in the Beckn Protocol v2.0.1 |
| [Quay](https://schema.nfh.global/Quay/README.md) | v2.0 | A specific platform, bay, or boarding area within a Stop Place at which passengers board or alight from a vehicle. |

| [RequestAction](https://schema.nfh.global/RequestAction/README.md) | v2.0 | DEPRECATED. This schema is structurally invalid and does not validate any payloads — the oneOf keyword was incorrectly nested inside properties, which is not valid JSON Schema.
Use https://schema.nfh.global/BecknAction/v2.0 instead. BecknAction is the unified envelope for all Beckn actions (both request and callback directions). The request/callback distinction is encoded in context.action (e.g. beckn/discover for requests, beckn/on_discover for callbacks).
This schema will be removed in a future major version. |
| [RequestDigest](https://schema.nfh.global/RequestDigest/README.md) | v2.0 | A cryptographic binding that explicitly ties a callback to the
specific inbound request that triggered it. Establishes bilateral non-repudiation
for the asynchronous leg of a Beckn interaction.

Use `lineage` (on `Context`) for cross-transaction causality.

Verification steps:
1. Recompute BLAKE2b-512 digest of the original request body; compare to `digest`.
2. Confirm `messageId` matches the `messageId` from the original request `Context`.

| [SpatialConstraint](https://schema.nfh.global/SpatialConstraint/README.md) | v2.0 | **Spatial predicate** using **OGC CQL2 (JSON semantics)** applied to one or more geometry targets in an item.

Key ideas: - `targets`: one or more **JSONPath-like** pointers that locate geometry    fields within each item document (e.g., `$['availableAt'][*]['geo']`). - `op`: spatial operator (CQL2). Common ones:      • `S_WITHIN`     (A is completely inside B)     • `S_INTERSECTS` (A intersects B)     • `S_CONTAINS`   (A contains B)     • `S_DWITHIN`    (A within distance of B) - `geometry`: **GeoJSON** literal used as the predicate reference geometry. - `distanceMeters`: required for `S_DWITHIN` when using a GeoJSON Point/shape. - `quantifier`: if a target resolves to an array, choose whether **ANY** (default),    **ALL**, or **NONE** of elements must satisfy the predicate.  CRS: unless otherwise stated, all coordinates are **EPSG:4326**. |
